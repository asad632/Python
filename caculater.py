# print(6+3)
# print(9-3)
# print(3*3)
# print(9/3) #floating point divison /, (4/2=2.0)
# print(2/4) # answer is 0.5
# #integer divison  //  ,(4//2=2) here is no floating point
# print(4//2)
# print(2//4) # answer is 0 because it will not show floating point
# #exponent it means 2power3 or2**3 (2*2*2=8)
# print(2**3)
# print(2**0.5) #0.5 means 2power 1/2
# #round function use to minimize the lenth of floating point
# print(round(2**0.5,3))# ,3 means how many deght of round i want
# print(2%6)
